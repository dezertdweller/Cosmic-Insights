# Cosmic Insights: Space Traffic and Risk Analysis

**Women in Data™ Datathon 2025 – Sustainability in Orbit**

This project analyzes **orbital congestion and conjunction risk** in **low Earth orbit (LEO)** using open-source datasets from the **18th Space Defense Squadron (SDS)** and the **Space-Track Satellite Catalog (SATCAT)**. With satellite numbers skyrocketing (3,371 in 2020 → 15,330 in 2025), our work highlights where space traffic is concentrated, how debris impacts safety, and what risks exist for active satellites.

## 🔑 Key Findings

* **LEO is crowded** – 85% of all tracked objects.
* **Constellations** (e.g., Starlink) dominate new payload growth.
* **Daily close approaches** number in the thousands; \~14% of payload-payload events have miss distances <1 km.
* **Risk is payload-driven** – active satellites are most vulnerable.

## 🛠️ Tools & Approach

* **Data**: TLEs (Elsets) + SATCAT metadata
* **Tech**: Python (pandas, NumPy, SGP4), Tableau
* **Workflow**: Ingestion → Cleaning → Orbital Density Analysis → Conjunction Risk Modeling

---

## ✅ Impact

Our analysis provides **evidence-based insights for policymakers and industry**, supporting sustainable orbital operations through:

* **Targeted monitoring** of congested shells
* **Debris mitigation & prevention policies**
* **International standards** for collision avoidance and information sharing
